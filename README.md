Ukkonen.cpp contains an implementation of the Ukkonen linear time suffix tree construction algorithm.
Similarly, McCreight.cpp contains an implementation of the McCreight linear time suffix tree construction algorithm.

The McCreight implementation was borrowed from ''https://github.com/Jingwen7/McCreight-Algorithm-Implementation/tree/master''. Fell free to refer to the repository for any details.

To run the algorithms:
- Clone the repository
- g++ Ukkonen.cpp or g++ McCreight.cpp
- ./a.out path_to_input_file
- In case of McCreight also pass the output path for the suffix tree to be saved.
